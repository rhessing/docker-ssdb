# docker-ssdb
Repo for SSDB (https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb) used by dockerhub for automated builds at: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/rhessing/ssdb

Please note that I've stopped maintaining this repo/docker image as I stopped using SSDB. SSDB is a very neat product, stable and very fast but it is not in any way suited for autoscaling within containerized environments. 

If anyone wants to use this image please feel free to do so, the image is self will be automatically updated when a new version of the base image is released.

If you want to make any contribution to this image you can issue a pull request and I'll check it as soon as possible.

For more information and documentation on how to use this image please see: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/rhessing/ssdb
